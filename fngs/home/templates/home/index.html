                    <p align="center">The brain, while superficially elegant, is an ovewhelmingly complex device consisting of billions of microscopic cells firing in unique patterns to create what we observe as thought. Imaging techniques such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) allow us to see these activation patterns in real time at a fine spatial resolution. Unfortunately, processing these graphs is a complex and expensive procedure. The initial investment in a processing pipeline may require hundreds of hours of labor to establish, and even using existing open source cutting edge tools requires a background in computer science and computer vision just to get the software installed and functioning properly; coupled with the extensive sets of options for processing, researchers looking to enter the computational neuroscience field may simply be barred by the learning curve to get involved. Through the Functional Neurodata Graphs Service, we hope to lower the barrier to entry of computational neuroscience. Our pipeline and quality control suite combine cutting edge existing open source software with many novel processing features, all wrapped in a simple-to-deploy docker container, so researchers will be able to ensure that they can easily and efficiently have their brain scans processed, along with easy to understand qualitative and quantitative metrics to ensure confidence in the outputs they receive. Together, the efforts of the Neurodata team combined with the latest generation of brain researchers will slowly unlock the mysteries of the brain, one connectome at a time.</p>
